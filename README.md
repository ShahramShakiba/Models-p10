> ### Introduction to Models
 - Models are representations of 3D objects. These models can be complex shapes, characters, vehicles, environments, or any other objects you might want to include in a 3D scene.
 - Models are typically created using 3D modeling software such as Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max, and then exported in formats that Three.js can understand, such as OBJ, FBX, GLTF, or STL.

> ### Why We Need to Import Models
1. Complexity and Detail:
   - Creating complex 3D objects manually with code can be highly time-consuming and error-prone. <br/> Modeling software allows artists and developers to create intricate and detailed models that can then be imported into Three.js.

2. Efficiency:
   - Importing pre-made models saves a significant amount of development time. Instead of coding every vertex and face, developers can focus on integrating and animating these models within their scenes.

3. Quality and Realism:
   - Professional 3D modeling tools offer a wide range of features that help create high-quality and realistic models. <br/> These tools provide various techniques and materials that are difficult to replicate manually in Three.js.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>> ### Benefits of Using Models
>> 1. Enhanced Visuals :
>>    - High-quality models enhance the visual appeal of the 3D scenes, making them more engaging and realistic. 
>> 2. Consistency :
>>    - Using models ensures that complex objects maintain consistent geometry and texture, reducing the risk of visual errors.
>> 3. Reusability :
>>    - Once created, models can be reused across different projects, saving time and effort in the long run.
>> 4. Collaboration :
>>    - Artists and developers can work separately, with artists focusing on creating models and developers on programming the scene and interactions. <br/> This separation of concerns streamlines the workflow.
>> 5. Animation and Rigging :
>>    - Models can include animations and rigging, allowing for complex movements and interactions within the 3D scene. <br/> This is essential for creating lifelike characters and dynamic environments.
