> To begin with, it is important to note that, this project have been sourced from an exceptional `Three.js Journey` Course. <br/>
 
### ðŸ‘¤ Instructed by a _proficient_ and _expert educator_ <a href="https://threejs-journey.com/" target="_blank"> _"Bruno Simon"_ </a>.  

 <br/>

> ### Introduction to Models
 - Models are representations of 3D objects. These models can be complex shapes, characters, vehicles, environments, or any other objects you might want to include in a 3D scene.
 - Models are typically created using 3D modeling software such as Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max, and then exported in formats that Three.js can understand, here are some popular formats such as OBJ, FBX, STL, PLY, COLLADA, 3DS and GLTF.

<br/> 

> ### GLTF
 - GLTF stands for ` GL Transmission Format `. <br/> It's made by the ` Khronos Group ` (the guys behind OpenGL, WebGL, Vulkan, Collada and with many members like AMD / ATI, Nvidia, Apple, id Software, Google, Nintendo, etc.)
 - It supports very different sets of data. You can obviously have data like the geometries and the materials but you can also have data like cameras, lights, scene graph, animations, skeletons, morphing and even multiple scene.
 - It also supports various file formats like json, binary, embed textures. <br/> <br/>
 - GLTF has become the standard when it comes to real-time. <br/> And because it's becoming a standard, most 3D softwares, game engines, and libraries support it. That means that you can easily have a similar result in different environments.

<br/> 

> ### Lightest and Best for Performance
#### 1. `  GLTF  ` (GL Transmission Format) 
- _Performance_:  <br/>  " Excellent! " Designed to be compact and efficient for web use. Supports binary and JSON encoding, which allows for fast loading and minimal file sizes.
- _Realism_:  <br/> " Good! " Supports PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) materials, animations, and a range of other features.
  
#### 2. `  OBJ  ` (Wavefront Object) 
- _Performance_: <br/> " Good! " Simple format with relatively small file sizes, but can become large if the model has a lot of detail.
- _Realism_: <br/> " Moderate! " Does not support advanced materials or animations natively.
  
#### 3. `  STL  ` (Stereolithography) 
- _Performance_: <br/> " Good! " Commonly used for 3D printing, the files are typically simple and contain only geometry without textures or materials.
- _Realism_: <br/> " Low! " Only supports geometry (vertices, edges, and faces) without color or material information.

<br/> 

> ### Balanced Performance and Realism
#### 4. `  PLY  ` (Polygon File Format) 
- _Performance_: <br/> " Moderate! " Can store additional data like color and normal vectors, which increases file size.
- _Realism_: <br/> " Moderate! " Better support for vertex colors and more detailed geometric data than STL.

#### 5. `  COLLADA  ` (Collaborative Design Activity, .dae)
- _Performance_: <br/> " Moderate to high! " XML-based format can be quite verbose, leading to larger file sizes.
- _Realism_: <br/> " Good! " Supports animations, complex geometries, and various materials.

<br/> 

> ### Most Detailed and Good for Realism
#### 6. `  FBX  ` (Filmbox)
- _Performance_: <br/> " High! " Can result in larger file sizes due to its comprehensive support for complex scenes.
- _Realism_: " Excellent! " Supports a wide range of features including animations, rigging, textures, and advanced materials.


#### 7. `  3DS  ` (3D Studio)
- _Performance_: <br/> " High !" Generally larger file sizes due to its detailed representation of objects.
- _Realism_: <br/> " Good to Excellent! " Supports detailed geometry, textures, and materials, though somewhat outdated compared to FBX.

<br/> 

> ### Summary
- Lightest and Best for Performance: &nbsp;&nbsp; { GLTF, OBJ, STL }
- Balanced Performance and Realism: &nbsp;&nbsp;{ PLY, COLLADA }
- Most Detailed and Good for Realism: &nbsp;&nbsp;{ FBX, 3DS } <br/> <br/>
For web-based applications using Three.js, "GLTF" is often the best choice due to its balance between performance and realism. <br/> It is optimized for fast loading, compact file sizes, and good visual fidelity, making it ideal for modern web applications.

 <br/>
 
> ### Why We Need to Import Models
1. Complexity and Detail:
   - Creating complex 3D objects manually with code can be highly time-consuming and error-prone. <br/> Modeling software allows artists and developers to create intricate and detailed models that can then be imported into Three.js.

2. Efficiency:
   - Importing pre-made models saves a significant amount of development time. Instead of coding every vertex and face, developers can focus on integrating and animating these models within their scenes.

3. Quality and Realism:
   - Professional 3D modeling tools offer a wide range of features that help create high-quality and realistic models. <br/> These tools provide various techniques and materials that are difficult to replicate manually in Three.js.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>> ### Benefits of Using Models
>> 1. Enhanced Visuals :
>>    - High-quality models enhance the visual appeal of the 3D scenes, making them more engaging and realistic. 
>> 2. Consistency :
>>    - Using models ensures that complex objects maintain consistent geometry and texture, reducing the risk of visual errors.
>> 3. Reusability :
>>    - Once created, models can be reused across different projects, saving time and effort in the long run.
>> 4. Collaboration :
>>    - Artists and developers can work separately, with artists focusing on creating models and developers on programming the scene and interactions. <br/> This separation of concerns streamlines the workflow.
>> 5. Animation and Rigging :
>>    - Models can include animations and rigging, allowing for complex movements and interactions within the 3D scene. <br/> This is essential for creating lifelike characters and dynamic environments.
